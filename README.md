# InfoExtract
InfoExtraction tool repository. Tool made for software technicians.
InfoExtract (Information Extraction) is a tool currently in it's testing phase. The tool when ran copies important hard drive information into text files and even copies entire files. The duration the extraction lasts is between 30 secs and 10 minutes based off which options you chose and the size of your operating system. Ann example of some of the extracted Infromation is active connections, current users, administrator information, windows directory, etc... Please keep in mind ALL THE EXTRACTED INFORMATION IS STORED IN AN EXTERNAL THUMB DRIVE (D:\) AND WILL NOT WORK IF YOU DO NOT HAVE AN EXTERNAL THUMB DRIVE SUCCESFULLY LINKED WITH YOUR MACHINE.

More important information to know is that your hard disk must be named C: and that your thumb drive must be named D:. All down loaded information is stored in a file "D:\Info_on_Your computer name" and is accesible by double clicking it. Most information is stored in text files except for the D:\WindowsFull file. 

You can find me on at my github and also download the file in case it doesn't work here at https://github.com/AleksAndPowershell/InfoExtract/blob/master/Infoextract.exe
